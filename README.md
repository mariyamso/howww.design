### home page design= empty room with white walls. Thatâ€™s what artists, designers, programmers, writers, filmmakers face: an empty page, absence of anything. Now, you want to create some meaningful: a story, an experience, a program. How to fill this space?
#### Philosophy
From the chaos of the world and plantitude of options, we narrow down our choice to the most efficient, expressive and functional solution

### Sections:

**If you are interested in design and unsure of where to start, dive in with me to explore.I am on my path of self-educating and teaching myself everything design-related. Here I aim to expand concepts of design and apply it to various work/life areas.**

### My principles:
-> *Form must fit function* =link beauty and purpose and thus can "create a sense of communal agreement that helps diminish the sense of disorder and incoherence that life creates" (Milton Glaser)
-> Tap into your hobbies and side projects = Because I have all these separate fields I enjoy, I need to find a great design
solution to organize them and present in an easy-to-navigate way. That in itself will communicate a skill of taking the complex and making it navigatable.

### Overarching questions
1. How to engage deeply with humans through design?
2. How to get a good hang of foundational skills of my medium?
3. How to innovate?
